The age ranges in our dataframes are slightly different from the age ranges in the diet_min and diet_max dataframes. For example, diet_min has daily allowances for Males from 4-8, but in our household data, we have age ranges such as Males from 1-5 and 5-10. Below, we try to solve this problem by taking averages of certain age ranges where there is varying overlap. In the end, we construct a dataframe that has the estimated recommended daily allowances for all of the age/sex ranges provided in the NSS data that we imported."
